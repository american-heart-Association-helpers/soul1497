# Antimatter Dimensions Ultimate
This is a compilation of several mods for AD. It includes all of the Aarex and dan-simon mods, like NG+x, NG-x, and NGUd, as well as a few I created myself. <br>

*This mod set is in its alpha version at the moment, so there will be a lot of glitches.* Many features will be broken right now. I suggest checking on this later when I actually end up completing anything. (As you might already know, I don't like doing things. I'll get around to finishing this eventually.)
